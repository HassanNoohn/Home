            <h2 id="whatistheflu">What is the flu?</h2>
			<p>The flu&sbquo; short for influenza&sbquo; is an illness that affects the respiratory system. More specifically&sbquo; the flu typically attacks the throat&sbquo; nose&sbquo; and in some cases&sbquo; the lungs. Symptoms of the flu include high fever&sbquo; sore throat or pain swallowing&sbquo; muscle ache&sbquo; running or blocked nose&sbquo; fatigue&sbquo; sneezing&sbquo; and coughing among others. There are three kinds of influenza viruses&sbquo; referred to as types A&sbquo; B&sbquo; and C&sbquo; which affect humans. However&sbquo; the two dominant forms of the flu are referred to as type A and B&sbquo; both of which cause the seasonal flu we typically see each year during flu season (in Canada&sbquo; late fall to early spring can be classified as flu season&sbquo; as this is when cases of influenza peak). Influenza A viruses are the most common. They can spread illness in animals as well as humans&sbquo; though humans are most typically the ones who endure the effects of this strain of the influenza virus. This type of influenza virus is responsible for the unlikely but possible flu epidemics and pandemics that are seen every so often. Symptoms seen with influenza A commonly include respiratory-specific symptoms and constitutional symptoms like malaise. Influenza B isn&rsquo;t encountered as often as type A but is  still more common than type C. This strain of the flu isn&rsquo;t found in animals&sbquo; only humans and cannot cause the pandemics type A is capable of causing&sbquo; only epidemics. Similar to type a&sbquo; type b also commonly causes both respiratory and constitutional symptoms. Type C is the least common type and least severe of the 3 types found in humans&sbquo; as it typically only causes respiratory-specific symptoms.</p>

			<h2 id="whydoweneedit">What is a flu shot and why do we need it?</h2>
			<p>The flu (influenza) shot is a vaccination typically administered in the arm. These vaccines generally shield against a maximum of 4 flu viruses which scientists predict will be most prevalent that year&rsquo;s flu season&sbquo; though it&rsquo;s important to note the vaccine prevents the flu&sbquo; not protects you from it completely. However&sbquo; even though it only prevents the flu&sbquo; it reduces the risk of catching the flu by roughly 50%. It&rsquo;s recommended that we get vaccinated with the flu shot annually&sbquo; as we never know for sure which mutated strain will be the most common that flu season. The flu virus mutates frequently due to the fact that it consists of a single-stranded RNA instead of the double-helix DNA. This creates an ideal situation for mutations because there&rsquo;s no corresponding base to recognize&sbquo; prevent&sbquo; and get rid of mutations. If the genetic material were to be DNA&sbquo; if a mutation were to occur (and it wasn&rsquo;t a neutral mutation) the nitrogenous bases wouldn&rsquo;t be complementary to each other and the polymerase would recognize and fix this when &rsquo;proofreading&rsquo; the code. Because we don&rsquo;t know for certain which flu viruses we will see&sbquo; it&rsquo;s vital that we get this vaccine seasonally in order to build antibodies to fight against the virus and prevent any severe effects&sbquo; as influenza is capable of leaving those sick with it in hospital beds and in extremely serious cases&sbquo; death.</p>

			<h2  id="whatistheimmunesystem">What is the immune system and how does it work?</h2>
			<p>The immune system is a defence system the human body utilizes when protecting against toxins&sbquo; bacteria&sbquo; and viruses among other things. Different proteins&sbquo; cells&sbquo; and organs make up the human immune system and the immune system can be divided into 2 primary parts: the innate immune system&sbquo; and the adaptive (or acquired) immune system. To understand how the flu vaccine works&sbquo; the role of the adaptive immune system must be understood first. The adaptive immune system works by developing antibodies to defend against a specific pathogen (disease-causing organisms). Immunoglobulin&sbquo; or an antibody&sbquo; is a protein shaped like a y. Antibodies can identify&sbquo; bind to&sbquo; and deactivate&sbquo; or neutralize&sbquo; pathogens and antigens (something that triggers an immune response found on the surface of a pathogen) by telling the white blood cell what needs to be destroyed. Specific&sbquo; specialized cells called B lymphocytes produce antibodies when the body comes in contact with an antigen. All it takes is one single exposure to a pathogen for your body to memorize and protect against it for future encounters with the same pathogen. With this key piece in mind&sbquo; I can now explain how the flu shot works. </p>

			<h2 id="howdoesitwork">How does the flu shot work?</h2>
			<p>The main takeaway from the last paragraph should&rsquo;ve been that all it takes is one single exposure to a pathogen for your body to memorize and protect against it for future encounters with the same pathogen. Inside the flu vaccine&sbquo; there are 3 or 4 strains of inactive or weakened parts of an influenza virus&sbquo; specifically the antigens located on the surface of the virus. These strains are always a mix of a and b strains but not type c. This is because type a and b tend to be much more severe compared to type c&sbquo; as the symptoms experienced with type a and b commonly include constitutional symptoms such as malaise as well as respiratory-specific symptoms. Type c&rsquo;s symptoms typically only include low-grade respiratory-specific symptoms. The number of strains found in the vaccine depends on whether the vaccine is quadrivalent (4 strains found inside) or trivalent (3 stains found inside). The adaptive immune system&sbquo; specifically the white blood cells&sbquo; will detect the foreign substances and the lymphocytes will develop antibodies to recognize the strains in the influenza shot. When your immune system comes in contact with the same strain&sbquo; except now it&rsquo;s an active virus&sbquo; the antibodies would recognize the antigens and bind to them. This would alert the rest of the immune system of the virus posing a possible threat and destroy it to prevent illness.</p>

			<h2 id="howistheflushotadministered">How is the flu shot administered?</h2>
			<p>The flu vaccine in the form of a shot is performed using the intramuscular injection technique. This technique is used to administer medicines or vaccines which require injection through the muscle instead of the bloodstream or tissue. First&sbquo; the healthcare professional will wash their hands and collect what they need to administer the shot. The main supplies needed include a fresh needle and syringe&sbquo; the medication&sbquo; and a puncture-proof container to discard the needle when the shot is complete. The upper arm is sterilized with rubbing alcohol to prep for the shot. A single dose of the vaccine is drawn into the syringe and air bubbles are removed. The nurse or doctor will insert the needle into the arm&sbquo; more specifically the deltoid muscle&sbquo; release the single dose of vaccine liquid&sbquo; and remove the needle. Typically&sbquo; a cover&sbquo; such as a bandaid or cotton and a bit of tape&sbquo; is put over the area where the shot was administered.</p>

			<h2 id="whatarethesideeffects">What are the side effects?</h2>
			<p>Though there are side effects to the flu vaccine&sbquo; they are usually light and don&rsquo;t cause much harm. Typically&sbquo; the list of side effects experienced by those who get the flu vaccine includes:</p>
			<ul id="sideEffects">
				<li>light fever</li>
				<li>headache</li>
				<li>sore muscles</li> 
				<li>nausea</li>
				<li>chills</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There have also been studies connecting Guillain Barr√© syndrome with the flu vaccine however even if the flu vaccine did have a connection with GBS&sbquo; this case scenario would be extremely rare&sbquo; with less than an estimated 0.000001 percent chance of this occurrence.</p>
